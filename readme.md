PicPile is a simple portfolio website, written in very basic Flask - This project has two main goals: 
- try to recreate the Windows XP Filmstrip styling as closely as reasonably possible
- Create an intuitive and extremely easy to use site to just dump all your pictures on

# Setup
 This project is still heavily WIP, and I have not released V1 of the code yet, so Setup is pending. but it'll basically consist of: 
 1. drop all the images you want to serve in the /pictures/ folder ( subfolders will be navigable, so you can use that to create different sections )
 2. with python and flask installed, start the server script
 3. that's it.

# Customization
**menubar.json** - This will contain all of the elements in the top menubar part of the site. You can leave it stock, or add your own custom links and junk!

# Why did I wanna make this?
I like to create visual artwork as a hobby, and I do it in a lot of different mediums, 3D blender art, little doodles and sketches, Film and Digital photography, the works.

After doing this for a while I realized that I really wanted to have a public place for my art to live, so I explored a bunch of the options there are out there

Some worked well enough for this task, but were inherently paid services, which I did not think my skill level justified really spending any money on it ( Think places like Adobe sites, Squarespace, etc )

There were also some open source alternatives out there, but most of what I could find were usually Very Complicated setups, requiring a lot of fiddling for each image you wanted to add. 

People tend to reccomend Blog software for this stuff, ( like WordPress ) but setting up wordpress, and especially going through image by image to set it up, it kind of a pain.

There are things like Instagram, but it's not very good for orginizing things into sections, and users have to also have an instagram account to look at the content reasonably easily. Also meta is evil, so..

I realized I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted a server that would simply show my images without any fuss. Something I could just dump a few folders in, and upload new images to whenever I felt like it!
I just wanted a pile of pictures. a picpile if you will
